# rust-wkb
Rust library to support well-known binary geometries

# Goals
The goal of rust-wkb is to support Well-Known Binary (WKB) geometries as per the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard. Once this has stabilized into full support for all known types, both for serialization to and deserialization from WKB, the library will be bumped up to a 1.0.0 release.
